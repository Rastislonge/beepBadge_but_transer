# BEEP BADGE
This project is inspired from a mix of concepts between an old product I was working on at my ex-job, a badge I wanted to make for a rave, the animal crossing tune creator. 
Result: a weird beeper badge XD

## Instruction
Go meet people at the con. Plug your badges together. The first person on the left presses "PLAY". The badge will start playing their 
tunes from left to right. Go make the coolest musical sequence!

## How to Program
Use an Atmel USB-ISP (USBASP) to flash the firmware. There is a programming connector at the top left of the badge labeled "Prog Port". Note the positive (+), negative (-) and reset (rst) label around the connector. Use it to match with the pinout of the USB-ISP. 
I used VScode+platformio to program and compile the firmware

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank Angel for their help in beta-testing the badge as they are much 
more musically inclined than 
I will ever be ^.^

Parts of the design from the Northsec Pegasis badge and the "Hello my name is" badge was used to rush the design of this badge.
